//You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person,

// Each boat carries at most two people at the same time,
// provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.
//
//Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
//Example 1:
//
//Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
//Output: 1
//Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
//Example 2:
//
//Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
//Example 3:
//
//Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
//Output: 4
//Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
